Runway Reservation System
A C++ console-based Runway Reservation System that allows scheduling and managing airplane landing times using a Binary Search Tree (BST). The system ensures that no two landings violate a k-minute separation rule and provides efficient reservation management using core Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts.

🔧 Features
✅ Landing Time Reservation
Add new aircraft landing times while ensuring k-minute separation from existing reservations.

🛬 Plane Landing Simulation
Simulates the real-time landing of scheduled aircraft and updates the system accordingly.

🔍 Reservation Queries
Get rank, find next/previous landings, and check schedule status.

✏️ Reservation Management
Insert, delete, or modify landing times efficiently.

📚 Data Structures & Algorithms Used
Binary Search Tree (BST)
Core data structure for storing and organizing landing times.

BST Operations
Insertion, Deletion, Search, In-order Traversal, and Rank Calculation.

Utility Algorithms
Custom logic to manage k-minute constraints and calculate landing positions.

String Parsing
Efficient parsing of time-based input (HH:MM format) to numeric and back.
