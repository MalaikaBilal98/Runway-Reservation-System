# Runway Reservation System

A C++ console-based **Runway Reservation System** that allows scheduling and managing airplane landing times using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**. The system ensures that no two landings violate a **k-minute separation rule** and provides efficient reservation management using core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts.

## Features

*  **Landing Time Reservation**
  Add new aircraft landing times while ensuring k-minute separation from existing reservations.

*  **Plane Landing Simulation**
  Simulates the real-time landing of scheduled aircraft and updates the system accordingly.

*  **Reservation Queries**
  Get rank, find next/previous landings, and check schedule status.

*  **Reservation Management**
  Insert, delete, or modify landing times efficiently.

## Data Structures & Algorithms Used

* **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
  Core data structure for storing and organizing landing times.

* **BST Operations**
  Insertion, Deletion, Search, In-order Traversal, and Rank Calculation.

* **Utility Algorithms**
  Custom logic to manage k-minute constraints and calculate landing positions.

* **String Parsing**
  Efficient parsing of time-based input (HH\:MM format) to numeric and back.
